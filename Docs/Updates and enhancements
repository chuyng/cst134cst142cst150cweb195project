Melville Theater website

Enhancements

In the future, a few ways to enhance the website would be to add more links to the Useful Links page that would be of
interest to your users, having a custom banner image created with the logo for your company, and adding more images
taken of the theater (an example would be a picture of popcorn from your concession stand).

Regular Maintenance

The Home page will require maintenance to update the carousel images for new movies being shown.
Now playing images and text will need to be updated for every new movie that you are showing.
Prices will need to be updated if they are ever changed.
