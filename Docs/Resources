We did most of our research on https://www.w3schools.com/. We used this website for information on CSS and how to
implement Bootstrap 4. We also used https://stackoverflow.com/ looking for solution from people who have had the same
problems as us.

 We used the Bootstrap 4 framework so that our website would transition between desktop and mobile views easily.
 Bootstrap also has many features that are very easy to implement and make the website look very nice, and are easy
 to interact with, we used the Google Maps API to show the location of the website so that a user will be able
 to find its location very easily, and jQuery validation for client-side validation inside of our forms.
